**Sequential counters with LED, ideal for speed test.**

On an Intel i-3770s, this schema achieved approximately 110 MHz.

For comparison, [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) on the same hardware achieved approximately 20 times less speed. However, it's important to note
that [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) and this project have different schema building principles, which may affect simulation speed. Additionally, this
project provides real-time feedback on achieved frequency, while [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) does not offer this feature.
