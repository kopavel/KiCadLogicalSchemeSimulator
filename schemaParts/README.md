## Schema parts

Some schema parts are interactive. Simulator create “representation” of that part on a “desc”.  
They can be drugged across the desk and allow you to arrange it layout to complete device look.  
Layout a stored at application exit in a file near '.net' or in KiKad project (if simulator started directly from iKiCad) with extension
`.sym_layout`.  
Some interactive parts has additional interfaces/functionality if you click on it.
