## Schema parts

Some schema parts are "interactive", that mean - simulator create "representation" of that part on a "desc".

That part can be drugged across the desk and allow you to arrange it layout to complete device look.
Layout are stored throe a menu or at application exit in a file near '.net' or in KiKad project (in case simulator started directly from iKiCad) with extension
`.sym_layout`.

Some of interactive part has additional interfaces/functionality if you click on it.
